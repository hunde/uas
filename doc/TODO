Todo list
---------

Front end
1 * Embedded forms for identification numbers (think of validation too!). After that send email to users and ask them to fill it in.
2 * If you try to register a new user - logout if still logged in
2 * Translation!
5 * uasValidatorCheckPassword -> rules in the help message!

Back end
1 * We can only have one FTP account, so if a user already has an ftp account we don't need to add a new one
2 * Translation!
3 * add help labels where needed - make sure they don't show up in the filters (or shorten them there)
4	- provide a printable version of the detail page
4 * In domain list, show for each domain user count, email accounts, ftp accounts, samba accounts, aliases
5 * remove the "is empty" from the filter fields where it isn't needed
5 * restrict the correct pages to the correct credentials as you see fit
5 * Redo the complete header and flash message placements
5 * Validator check up:
	$this->validatorSchema['password'] = new sfValidatorAnd(
		new sfValidatorString(array('required' => true)),
		new uasValidatorCheckPassword()
	);

Nice to have
-------------

*  persons picture with the users (image upload)
*  add a "server" table to the system
* Modify filters: in a filter we should not see a dropdown with users, but a input field, (if we have many users the dropdown will be unasable
* ADD unit TESTS
* ADD functional TESTS

Figure out why filter_is_empty isn't working as it should
