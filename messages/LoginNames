Dear #FIRSTNAME# #FATHERSNAME#,

With the previous Notification about UAS system, there has been some problems. As the ICT Develpment Office always concerns and tried to provide you good services, we would now like to inform you that the link to UAS http://mail.ju.edu.et/uas/ is now working properly. 

In addition to that, the change password feature has also been made a bit loose, but for security reason, the system wants you to have the following in your password:  
1. include two digits (0-9)
2. and any characters, 
3. minimum password length of 8

And to remind you again, the login name that you should use in order to login to the http://mail.ju.edu.et/uas/ is #LOGIN#.

Thank you for your cooperation
ICT Development Office
